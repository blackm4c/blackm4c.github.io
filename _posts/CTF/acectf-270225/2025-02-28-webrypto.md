## Initial Analysis

### Challenge Description

```
I think we can all agree that most of us grew up watching the iconic cartoon Tom & Jerry. Every kid would feel that surge of adrenaline during the thrilling chases and chaotic conflicts between the mischievous mouse and the ever-determined cat. The excitement of those scenes—the heart-pounding moments of escape—sometimes felt almost real.

But then, I heard a little rumor: what if all those chases were fake? What if Tom and Jerry were actually friends all along? That revelation shook me. I had no one to ask about this mind-bending twist, so I decided to take matters into my own hands—I created a web app to settle this question once and for all.

I know the truth now. Do you think you can uncover it too?
```

When visiting the website, I found a PHP source code snippet:

```php
<?php
include('flag.php');
highlight_file(__FILE__);

// Check if parameters 'tom' and 'jerry' are not equal
if ($_GET['tom'] != $_GET['jerry']) {
    echo "<br>Parameter 1 Met!<br>";

    if (md5('ACECTF' . $_GET['tom']) == md5('ACECTF' . $_GET['jerry'])) {
        echo $FLAG;  // If the condition is true, print the flag
    }
}
```

### Understanding the Code

1. The script includes `flag.php`, which contains the flag.
2. The source code of the file is displayed.
3. It checks if the `tom` and `jerry` GET parameters have different values.
4. It applies an MD5 hash with the salt `ACECTF` and compares the results.
5. If both conditions are satisfied, the flag is printed.

## Analysis and Exploitation

### Step 1: Bypassing the First Condition

To pass the first condition, `tom` and `jerry` must have different values. A simple URL like this works:

```
https://webchall.link/?tom=a&jerry=b
```

This satisfies `$_GET['tom'] != $_GET['jerry']`.

### Step 2: Bypassing the Hash Check

PHP’s MD5 function is vulnerable to hash collisions, but since a salt (`ACECTF`) is added, a traditional MD5 collision attack won’t work. However, there is another vulnerability in PHP: **an error-handling flaw caused by hashing an array**.

### Step 3: Exploiting the Vulnerability:

If we send the parameters as arrays, PHP will treat them differently when hashing. Using the following payload:

```
https://webchall.link/?tom[0]=0&jerry[1]=0
```

- `tom[0] = 0` and `jerry[1] = 0` are treated as arrays.
- The first condition `(tom != jerry)` is still true because PHP treats array comparisons differently. Since `tom = array(0=>0)` and `jerry = array(1=>0)`, they are considered different arrays, thus passing the first check.
- When PHP tries to hash the values using MD5, it expects a string but receives an array, leading to an **error-to-null vulnerability**.
- Since `md5("ACECTF".NULL) == md5("ACECTF".NULL)` always evaluates to true, this occurs because PHP attempts to hash an array, which is invalid. When `md5()` receives an array instead of a string, PHP triggers a warning: `Warning: md5() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given`. As a result, MD5 returns `NULL` for both values, making them identical and passing the comparison check. When attempting to hash an array, PHP throws a warning and returns `NULL`. As a result, both hashes compare as equal, satisfying the second condition and revealing the flag!

### Conclusion

This challenge demonstrates an **error-handling flaw** in PHP, where comparisons between arrays and strings behave unexpectedly. Instead of exploiting hash collisions directly, we bypassed the security check using a **PHP array conversion trick**.

### Key Takeaways

- PHP has weak type handling that can lead to unintended vulnerabilities.
- MD5 is not collision-resistant, but adding a salt makes basic attacks harder.
- Using arrays in GET parameters can lead to unexpected behaviors in security checks.
- Error-handling flaws can be exploited when input validation is not strict.
- PHP generates a warning when trying to hash an array, but the execution continues, which can be leveraged for exploits.

Hope this write-up helps you in future CTF challenges!
